# 🎯 **CLAY WEBHOOK INTEGRATION - EXPLAINED**

## 🔄 **HOW YOUR DATA GETS TO CLAY**

You're getting **200 responses** which means everything is working! Here's where your EDP analysis data goes:

### **📍 Clay Webhook URL (Where Data Goes):**
```
https://api.clay.com/v3/sources/webhook/pull-in-data-from-a-webhook-ba8d0100-6e0f-4c26-8523-fac369f75a18
```

## 🚀 **TWO INTEGRATION OPTIONS:**

### **Option 1: Clay Calls Your API ⭐ RECOMMENDED**
```
Clay → POST to your Railway API → Response back to Clay
```

**How it works:**
1. Clay sends company data to your Railway API: `{"company_name": "ABC Corp", "domain": "abc.com"}`
2. Your API analyzes with WebsiteEvidenceExtractor (complete EDP analysis)
3. Your API returns complete response to Clay
4. Clay receives data in its webhook receiver

**Railway Endpoint:** `https://your-app.up.railway.app/pain-signal-webhook`

**Clay receives:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "analysis": {
    "company_name": "ABC Corp",
    "domain": "abc.com", 
    "total_pain_score": 1.46,
    "weighted_psi_score": 36.5,
    "qualification_tier": "TIER_B_ACTIVE",
    "edp_rankings": [
      ["rep_performance_crisis", 0.71, "strong"],
      ["sales_enablement_collapse", 0.50, "moderate"],
      ["technology_obsolescence", 0.186, "weak"]
    ],
    "evidence_hooks": "No rep/dealer locator found...",
    "personalization_hooks": [{"type": "company_name", "value": "Attention Required!"}],
    // ... complete EDP analysis with all 5 EDPs
  }
}
```

### **Option 2: Your API Sends TO Clay**
```
Your API → Analysis → POST to Clay webhook URL
```

**How it works:**
1. Your API receives company data (from any source)
2. Analyzes with WebsiteEvidenceExtractor 
3. Sends results directly to Clay webhook URL
4. Clay receives data in its webhook receiver

**Implementation:** Added `/analyze-and-send` endpoint with Clay integration

## 📊 **YOUR DATA STRUCTURE (Already Working!)**

When Clay receives your analysis, it gets:

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "total_pain_score": 1.46,      // ← Clay uses this for lead scoring
    "qualification_tier": "TIER_B_ACTIVE", // ← Clay uses this for segmentation  
    "edp_rankings": [...],          // ← Clay uses this for personalization
    "evidence_hooks": "...",        // ← Clay uses this for outreach context
    "personalization_hooks": [...], // ← Clay uses this for custom messaging
    // Complete EDP analysis with all scoring and findings
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **CLAY CONFIGURATION (Next Steps)**

### **1. Configure Clay Webhook Source:**
- **Type:** Webhook
- **URL:** `https://your-app.up.railway.app/pain-signal-webhook`
- **Method:** POST
- **Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:** `{"company_name": "{{company_name}}", "domain": "{{domain}}"}`

### **2. Clay Access Fields:**
```javascript
// Clay formulas can access:
analysis.total_pain_score         // Lead scoring
analysis.qualification_tier       // Segmentation (TIER_A_IMMEDIATE, TIER_B_ACTIVE, TIER_C_NURTURE)
analysis.edp_rankings[0][0]      // Top EDP for personalization
analysis.edp_rankings[0][1]      // Top EDP score
analysis.evidence_hooks          // Outreach context
analysis.missing_features        // Pain point details
```

### **3. Clay Formula Examples:**
```javascript
// Lead Scoring Formula:
IF(analysis.total_pain_score > 2.0, "HOT LEAD",
   IF(analysis.total_pain_score > 1.0, "WARM LEAD", "COLD LEAD"))

// Personalization Formula:
analysis.edp_rankings[0][0].replace("_", " ").toUpperCase() + 
" - Pain Score: " + analysis.total_pain_score

// Tier-based Routing:
IF(analysis.qualification_tier == "TIER_A_IMMEDIATE", "SALES",
   IF(analysis.qualification_tier == "TIER_B_ACTIVE", "DEMO", "NURTURE"))
```
