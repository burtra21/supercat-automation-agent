# SuperCat Automation Agent

## Overview

Automated GTM (Go-To-Market) system for SuperCat that analyzes prospects, identifies pain points, and generates personalized outreach campaigns. The system processes company data, performs website analysis, and creates webhooks for Clay integration with email sequences, LinkedIn messages, and ads.

## üéØ Project Status: PRODUCTION READY

**Critical Issue Resolved**: All fabricated case studies have been removed and replaced with verified customer testimonials and data-driven messaging.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

- **Analysis Pipeline** (`full_pipeline_v2.py`) - Enhanced website analysis using WebsiteEvidenceExtractorV2
- **Webhook Generator** (`generate_webhooks.py`) - Creates analysis and campaign webhooks for Clay
- **Email Generation** - Template-based system with pain-point specific messaging using verified data
- **Database Integration** - Supabase storage for company data and analysis results
- **API Redundancy** - OpenAI primary, Anthropic Claude fallback

### Data Flow

```
CSV Input ‚Üí Website Analysis ‚Üí PSI Calculation ‚Üí Campaign Generation ‚Üí Clay Webhook
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env` file with:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL=your_clay_webhook_url
```

### Run Pipeline v2 (Recommended)

```bash
# Process 5 companies from prospects.csv
python3 full_pipeline_v2.py prospects.csv 5

# Process all companies
python3 full_pipeline_v2.py prospects.csv
```

### Generate Webhooks Only

```bash
# Generate both analysis and campaign webhooks
python3 generate_webhooks.py prospects.csv --type both

# Generate only campaign webhooks
python3 generate_webhooks.py prospects.csv --type campaign
```

## üìß Email Template System

### ‚úÖ **FIXED: Fabricated Case Study Issue**

**Previous Problem**: Email templates contained completely fabricated metrics and success stories that posed legal and credibility risks.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Removed all unverified claims and fake case studies
- Replaced with real customer testimonials from supercatsolutions.com
- Used only verified statistics from $2.3M customer portfolio analysis

### New Email Template Philosophy

1. **Human & Empathetic**: Acknowledge challenges without judgment
2. **Question-Based Discovery**: Ask genuine questions to test pain relevance  
3. **Evidence-Based**: Use only verified patterns from validation study
4. **Value-First**: Offer insights before asking for anything
5. **Concise**: 90 words or less, respectful of time

### Template Structure

Each EDP has 3 email sequences:

#### **EDP1: SKU Complexity**
- **Email 1**: Configuration chaos identification
- **Email 2**: Manual process impact (with Butler Specialty quote if relevant)
- **Email 3**: Competitive gap reality check

#### **EDP7: Sales Enablement** (Primary - 100% customer correlation)
- **Email 1**: Mobile/trade show process questions
- **Email 2**: Mobile transformation story (Godinger Silver quote)
- **Email 3**: Efficiency gap acknowledgment

#### **EDP8: Technology Obsolescence** (Secondary - 93% correlation)
- **Email 1**: PDF/manual process challenges
- **Email 2**: Version control problems (Wildwood Lamps quote if relevant)
- **Email 3**: Digital transformation simplification

#### **EDP2: Rep Performance Crisis** (71% correlation)
- **Email 1**: Rep visibility challenges
- **Email 2**: Performance pattern insights
- **Email 3**: Talent retention focus

#### **EDP6: Channel Conflict** (43% correlation)
- **Email 1**: Multi-channel pricing consistency
- **Email 2**: Relationship impact warning
- **Email 3**: Unified pricing urgency
