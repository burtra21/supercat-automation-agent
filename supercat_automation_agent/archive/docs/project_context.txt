# SUPERCAT GTM AUTOMATION AGENT - PROJECT BRIEF

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
You are building an automated Go-To-Market system for Supercat Solutions, a real company that provides mobile sales enablement software (eCat) for B2B manufacturers and distributors with complex pricing needs.

## BUSINESS CONTEXT

### The Company
- **Supercat Solutions**: Mobile sales platform for furniture/lighting manufacturers
- **Product**: eCat - iPad app for sales reps, B2B portal, admin console
- **Founded**: 2010, established with major clients
- **Key Differentiator**: Works offline (critical for trade shows), handles complex "Grade Jump Riser Pricing"

### Real Customer Testimonials (USE THESE IN MESSAGING)
1. Butler Specialty - Monty Sihweil, President: "eCat flexibly configures to the way we do business"
2. Godinger Silver - Joel Stern, VP IT: "Best thing in 25 years, reps are in love"
3. Wildwood Lamps - Erin Yevak: "Reduced calls by a third"

### Target Market Problems
- **30% order error rate** with manual processes (industry average)
- **5-7% margin erosion** from pricing errors on configurations
