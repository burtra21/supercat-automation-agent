Thought you might find this interesting...

We just analyzed 100 furniture manufacturers and found:
- 73% still use manual order processing
- Average rep spends 3 hours/day on admin
- 30% error rate at trade shows

{analysis['company_name']} seems to be ahead in some areas but might benefit from seeing what industry leaders are doing.
